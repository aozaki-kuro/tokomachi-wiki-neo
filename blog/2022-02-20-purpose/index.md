## The Purpose

The Tokomachi Wiki is a fan-made site that has compiled the activities and events involving the unit <span style={{ color: "#e93320" , fontWeight: "bold" }}>Toko</span><span style={{ color: "#00b8ed" , fontWeight: "bold" }}>machi</span> (Inui Toko & Hoshimachi Suisei).

[Starting in 2019](/timeline/2019#the-birth-of-tokomachi-), they were good friends, who admired and respected each other. Over the next two years, the unit also proved itself with breathtakingly attractive live performances and showing their live activities.

For Suisei, Toko's performance [influenced her in a way](/timeline/2019#turning-point-), that led to her choice of Tenkyuu for her solo performance on Non-Stop Story, 2019, which gained her tremendous popularity after the event.

For Toko, Suisei [provided the motivation](/timeline/2021#small-revenge-) to do more musical work, such as new songs, solo events, and live performances. It was Toko that [first invited Suisei to her 1st solo live](/topics/toko_who_i_am), breaking the live event barrier between Hololive and Nijisanji.

Both Suisei and Toko mentioned in Tokomachi Radio (Temp) Episode 14 that they [both want to learn English](/radio/episode/s2e14#new-challenges-in-2022) to communicate with the EN audiences and other EN Vtubers. But I found that was so little translated EN content about their interactions, so I decided to do it myself and help them to expand their territories.

If you are interested in the activities and events of this brilliant music unit, please start from [<Fa name={[ 'solid' , 'feather-pointed' ]} /> Timeline: 2019](/timeline/2019)

### The Contents

The contents came directly from Inui Toko and Hoshimachi Suisei's stream and archives.

It was mostly **translation** and **summarizing** works.

### Keeping the Contents Neutral

Yes, this is also one of the purpose, and it's why I named this _Tokomachi Wiki_.

But me as a big Tokomachi fan, also know clearly it's impossible for me to achieve the purpose alone. It's 100% impossible to keep all the contents neutral as possible during my writings.

So the site / project is also open to the public: if you found any typos, anything missing, or anything inappropriate, you can edit it on GitHub, or contact through Marshmallow.

### Misunderstandings

Don't get it wrong, the purpose of the site was for introduction and let the non-JP communities know more details about why Inui Toko and Hoshimachi Suisei are good / close friends, also how did they influenced each other in music as a _Unit_.

## To-do

So far the site should be up-to-date and awaits for further activities, for now.

/** To-do list */

        2. Refactor the homepage icon & animation

    )
}

    return (
        // Content
        1. Fact-checking

    )
