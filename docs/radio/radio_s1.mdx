:::info About the content

Most episodes were just chatting, only rather important or interesting topics would be picked out and recorded.

:::

**Full Title:** Tokomachi Radio (Temp)

The radio program was a variety show started by 2 girls chasing their dreams.

The first step was this radio program.

## Episode 01: The Start

<Date D="2020-10-28" />

The first episode, both of them still can't believe it came true. They said this was their first step towards their dreams.

Their dreams were

- Duo radio program
- Duo original songs
- Duo live concerts

They dreamed of singing and dancing together on Toyosu PIT. They succeed in that after a year on [<SNSIcon /> Suisei's 1st Solo Live](/topics/suisei_galaxy).

They received 300+ letters for their first episode and chose 4 to read.

Toko's conclusion of Suisei: _Singing, Tetris, Psychopath_.

Suisei's conclusion of Toko: _Singing, Night Fishing, Chatting_.

Somehow Tokomachi often got some trouble singing together, because Toko's highest key was way more lower than Suisei's lowest key. This affected their choice on songs singing together.

For them, _Ensemble Stars !!_ was their bible of _how to become an idol_ and their favorite line was _Only love does not make an idol, but without love you would never be an idol._

In the end they re-announced [Toko's 1st solo live](/topics/toko_who_i_am) and announced [their first cover MV](/timeline/2020#first-tokomachi-cover-mv).

## Episode 02

<Date D="2020-11-25" />

> <YTLink Id="ZONauvZUkEY" />

Suisei was extremely noisy from the beginning.

The beloved _Voice-cracking Romeo_ scene also came from this episode.

> <YTTime Id="ZONauvZUkEY" Time="25:08" Desc="Voice-cracking Romeo" /> (Please reduce the volume)

<details> <summary>Translation</summary>

:comet: : OHHHHHHH JULIET!!!!!!! WHY YOU ARE JULIEEET?????????????

:tropical_drink: : (Laughing)

:comet: : JULIET PLEASE LET ME HEAR YOUR VOICE JULIET!!!

:tropical_drink: : (Laughing) Romeo, I, I cannot breath...

:comet: : WHY!!! HAVE YOU DRUNK THE POISON JULIET???

:tropical_drink: : I...I want...

:comet: : WHY!!! WHY JULIET!!!

:tropical_drink: : Let me speak Romeo...

:comet: : OH YOU CAN STILL TALK JULIET! TELL ME WHAT'S WRONG!

:tropical_drink: : There's only 2 seconds left.

Note: Romeo was supposed to stay low as possible every time he tried to meet Juliet secretly.

## Episode 03

<Date D="2020-12-23" />

> <YTLink Id="s6OPCzpCep4" />

They were in a event rush at that time. Especially Suisei had 5 lives to attend so they did this episode in a very casual pace.

They were very happy at people started EnSta after watching their performances on Toko's 1st solo live.

They mentioned that they spent a lot of time in the studio practising the dance steps. They also had to record their dance steps to confirm how were they doing before going to studio. So they got a full record from clumsy to masterly, which, they claimed to be a pretty precious memory.

## Episode 04

<Date D="2021-01-27" />

> <YTLink Id="Kr1jxq0ms00" />

This is the first episode in 2021 so there were a lot of talks about the new year plans.

> <YTTime Id="VH0XOn6ceSA" Time="04:42" Desc="Confirmation" />

Toko and Suisei got a special way to confirm that each other is awake before going out to play together.

<details> <summary>Tokomachi's way</summary>

:tropical_drink: : RISKY VENUS!

:comet: : HEY!

</details>

> <YTTime Id="VH0XOn6ceSA" Time="22:47" Desc="What is idol?" />

One of the fan letters asked Tokomachi "What is idol?" and they thought a long time.

The final answer was pretty unexpected.

<details> <summary>Tokomachi's answer</summary>

:comet: : Everyone that shines bright!

:tropical_drink: : Hoshimachi Suisei.

## Episode 05: with Houshou Marine

<Date D="2021-02-24" />

![marine](./assets/20210224.jpg)

:::note

The content would be more focused on Tokomachi.

:::

> <YTLink Id="5JpC8ec5dfw" />

This was the first time having a guest on air with them. Since there were only 2 chairs, Suisei had to sit with Toko.

The reason inviting [<SNSIcon /> Houshou Marine](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCzUftO8KOVkV4wQG1vkUvg) (aka Sennchou) was pretty simple: Among all hololive members, she's interested in Marine most. While being pretty familiar with Suisei, Marine tried to start the talk with Toko by talking some NSFW talks (in Marine's word, _horny_ topics), Toko reacted to those with a indifferent reaction.

Both Toko and Suisei had to do something to stop Marine from talking NSFW topics in the stream.

Since Suisei's hair color was similar with Lize Helesta, Marine's was similar with Ange Katerina, `Toko + Suisei + Marine` was also considered _Sanbaka Alter_ to some extent.

### Timestamps

- [ <YTTime Id="5JpC8ec5dfw" Time="13:51" /> ] According to Suisei, Toko can be categorized as S (Sadistic).
- [ <YTTime Id="5JpC8ec5dfw" Time="28:49" /> ] Suisei didn't know what _outlying island_ was, same did Marine. Suisei even said _Is Japan an outlying island?_ Toko was so amused, she laughed a lot and said _Are you two idiots_.
- [ <YTTime Id="5JpC8ec5dfw" Time="46:42" /> ] In the last short drama, Suisei was the prince, Marine was the Demon and Toko was the princess. Marine tried hard to stop Suisei to save Toko and the "fight" was pretty fierce. In the end Toko suddenly said _But I would marry the prince!_ and Marine, the Demon was so said and left quietly.

## Episode 06: with Ange Katerina :star:

<Date D="2021-03-25" />

![Ange](./assets/20210325.jpg)

:::note

The content would be more focused on Tokomachi.

:::

> <YTLink Id="nlkJdUZU5Ws" />

For Episode 6, they invited [<SNSIcon /> Ange Katerina](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHVXbQzkl3rDfsXWo8xi2qw) as the guest. Suisei had met Ange during Toko's 1st solo live preparations and rehearsals.

It was considered _Sanabaka Alter (mini)_ this time (Suisei ≒ Lize).

### Timestamps

- [ <YTTime Id="nlkJdUZU5Ws" Time="03:20" /> ] Toko mentioned Suisei's change in her voice on 22th March, her 3rd Anniversary. Suisei said she was so nervous and worried about that, also consulted Toko for a long time, but it turned out that her audiences accepted it pretty flawlessly.
- [ <YTTime Id="nlkJdUZU5Ws" Time="09:15" /> ] Suisei made up some scenes that never happened like they talked a lot, went together for meal or went to Karaoke together etc. which made Ange felt shy and Toko was so amused that she cannot help laughing. Toko even pretended to be jealousy when Suisei said _Hey we also went to the hotel for a girls' talk_.
- [ <YTTime Id="nlkJdUZU5Ws" Time="10:51" /> ] Suisei said she once had an overnight party in a hotel.
- [ <YTTime Id="nlkJdUZU5Ws" Time="14:33" /> ] Toko mentioned that during her 1st solo live, the green room was separated, but still Suisei went to NIJISANJI's green room often and played with the others. Suisei also claimed _I'm also one of NIJISANJI, for today only_.
- [ <YTTime Id="nlkJdUZU5Ws" Time="17:17" /> ] Suisei said she was confused when she first saw Ange's debut stream, wondering what was Ange's actual gender. The answer made Toko laughed from the beginning to the end and said _I can't believe you were bothered by this for so long!_
- [ <YTTime Id="nlkJdUZU5Ws" Time="21:19" /> ] Ange thought Suisei's interactions with Toko was pretty funny, they always kept talking.
- [ <YTTime Id="nlkJdUZU5Ws" Time="22:55" /> ] Toko mentioned their ways to laugh started to exchange. Suisei often Aha↑ loudly in the street of Tokyo and Toko started to laugh in a more "modest" way.

### Katerina Family

One of the fan letters asked what position they would be if they were family members.

Suisei and Toko immediately answered and agreed that they should be **twin sisters**.

And Ange should be the **father** spoiling the daughters, while Lize should be the strict **mother**. Ange herself also agreed on this and Toko even imitated what Lize might say when Ange try to spoil the daughters.

<details> <summary>Imaginary Angry Lize Mama 💢</summary>

:crown: : Ange why do you always leave this kind of things to me!

:crown: : You never tell them it's wrong and that's why it's always happening!

:scales: : B, But I don't want to be hated by them...

</details>

Toko and Suisei then act as if they were the baby daughters and Ange cannot resist the temptation to spoil them.

## Episode 07: Off Collab

<Date D="2021-04-30" />

> <YTLink Id="kR9mSvUyfkY" />

This was a special episode having Toko streaming with Suisei together at Suisei's apartment. Tokomachi both had their Live2D avatar activated.

#### Major Topics

The major topic was about Suisei's 3rd Anniversary Live "SPACE for Virtual GHOST".

<FYI Topic="SPACE for Virtual GHOST" Desc="/topics/suisei_ghost#tokomachi-side" />

#### Other Topics

The best songs for them were _Ensemble Stars_ songs.

If they are going to have a band, Suisei would be the pianist and Toko would play [<Fa name={[ 'brands' , 'wikipedia-w' ]} /> Shakuhachi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakuhachi).

If they can only eat one kind of food for a year, they choose to eat fried chicken or potato chips.

About the childhood dream job. Suisei's was idol singer and Toko's was Cerberus.

They both lie about their jobs to the barbers.

## Episode 08

<Date D="2021-05-28" />

> <YTLink Id="8sqE4VgaT0w" />

Another beloved scene, _Suisei making grated radish_ came from this episode.

> <YTTime Id="8sqE4VgaT0w" Time="07:13" Desc="Suisei making grated radish" />

This happened during Toko's stay at Suisei for an overnight party. Suisei was making dinner for Toko and grated radish was one of both Toko and Suisei's favorite dish. But her movements were so exaggerated and funny, her full body and her hair was shaking fiercely as if there was an earthquake.

Toko was amused by this at first glance and took a video of this.

There was an official animated clip for this in [Episode 13](/radio/tokomachi_radio_s1#episode-13-1st-anniversary-).

Other topics:

- [ <YTTime Id="8sqE4VgaT0w" Time="11:08" /> ] They do share dishes when going out for meal, but only those acceptable ones (e.g. french fries). They still tend to order different dishes.
- [ <YTTime Id="8sqE4VgaT0w" Time="18:29" /> ] They both tend to sleep or staying at home relaxed during heavy rain days (unless there's work).

## Episode 09

<Date D="2021-06-24" />

> <YTLink Id="RrX2uuMeAW8" />

> <YTTime Id="RrX2uuMeAW8" Time="02:18" Desc="It's already episode 9" />

Both Toko and Suisei were surprised that they were able to reach Episode 9. The title _Tokomachi Radio (Temp)_ seemed like already had been accepted as the formal title. Toko also mentioned that they did asked their audiences if there were better ideas in title renaming. But a lot of them thought Tokomachi won't treat it formally and would stop after doing a few episodes.

> <YTTime Id="RrX2uuMeAW8" Time="12:08" Desc="Menu for Tokomachi Cafe?" />

One of the fan letters asked what would Tokomachi arrange for their collab Cafe.

<details> <summary>Tokomachi Menu</summary>

- Cream soda
- Apple juice
- French fries decorated with
  - _Confeito_
  - Unknown flower from the underworld
- Meat (Barbecue)
- _Shabushabu_
- Suisei-motif desserts
  - Chiffon cake with strawberry (and a _su_ stands for for Suisei)

</details>

Since both Toko and Suisei were not that in favor of desserts and sweets they have no further plans to put more on their menu.

> <YTTime Id="RrX2uuMeAW8" Time="18:48" Desc="Reactions on horror games" />

Toko and Suisei streamed [<Fa name={[ 'brands' , 'steam' ]} /> Night Delivery](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1611490/Night_Delivery) several days before the radio. Suisei was scared and screamed on a jump scare scene while Toko reacted very calmly as if she's wondering _what the hell are you doing?_

Their audiences also noticed that Toko and Suisei's collab (except radio) were only Minecraft or chatting. The only non-Minecraft collab stream was that EnSta gatcha stream but the archive were privated.

Toko was not afraid of horror games, but she hated to be chased in games. Also both of them thought Minecraft is somehow more terrifying than most horror games because of Enderman and silverfish.

They planned to try something else for game collab like [<Fa name={[ 'brands' , 'steam' ]} /> Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes](https://store.steampowered.com/app/341800/Keep_Talking_and_Nobody_Explodes/) or [<Fa name={[ 'solid' , 'palette' ]} /> Gartic Phone](https://garticphone.com/) as a start, but so far (till Feb. 2022) they weren't able to take a step forward on game collab. The only exception was they both got invited to Shiro's channel for Mario Party collab.

## Episode 10

<Date D="2021-07-30" />

> <YTLink Id="pT5uYMHtmL0" />

They first talked about the release of Toko's 1st solo live Blu-ray disc.

> <YTTime Id="pT5uYMHtmL0" Time="50:40" Desc="Eggplant doria with no eggplant please" />

This was the most beloved funny scene from Tokomachi Radio S1.

Suisei was such a picky eater that she nearly refuse to eat any kind of vegetables.

<details> <summary>Eggplant doria with no eggplant please</summary>

<Date D="2021-08-26" />

> <YTLink Id="B3ZDoOxQjnA" />

This episode was after Suisei's announcement of 1st album and 1st solo live, also right after Toko's 1st solo live Blu-ray sale. Toko's 1st solo live Blu-ray also won the 1st place in Oricon Blu-ray ranking.

Other topics:

- [ <YTTime Id="B3ZDoOxQjnA" Time="03:19" /> ] Toko replied immediately that would buy about 3 copies of their favorite album CD or live concert Blu-ray, while Suisei buy less goods.
- [ <YTTime Id="B3ZDoOxQjnA" Time="12:47" /> ] Toko decided part her live goods because _she wanted that_. Suisei never thought about the reason, just did it with her instinct.
- [ <YTTime Id="B3ZDoOxQjnA" Time="15:44" /> ] Toko said back to the rehearsal of her solo live, she once spotted an unrelated staff was wearing Suisei's motif T-shirt. She didn't recognized that at first glance and thought it was pretty cute.

## Episode 12

> <YTLink Id="21ELJRyo-xI" />

It was the 12th episode of the year, so it was _not_ 1st anniversary yet. Tokomachi got it wrong and nearly marked this as anniversary.

Toko talked about how Suisei invited her to attend her live as a guest.

<FYI Topic="STELLAR into the GALAXY" Desc="/topics/suisei_galaxy#suiseis-way-to-toko-as-guest" />

Other topics:

- [ <YTTime Id="21ELJRyo-xI" Time="16:16" /> ] Toko also checked Suisei's hashtag of her 1st album _Still Still Stellar_. She read the tweets while listening to the album. She felt really happy for Suisei and also loved the album very much.
- [ <YTTime Id="21ELJRyo-xI" Time="37:00" /> ] Toko was pretty happy that people thought she would definitely attend Suisei's live as a guest. But still Toko it's not easy to actually stand on the stage with Suisei.
- [ <YTTime Id="21ELJRyo-xI" Time="38:13" /> ] Toko mentioned there were not too many inter-agencies scheduled programs by that time when Tokomachi radio started (Oct 2021). Even people was pretty pessimistic on the program and thought it might end in a month or two, they at least carried on for nearly a year by now.
- [ <YTTime Id="21ELJRyo-xI" Time="48:07" /> ] Toko mentioned once she asked Suisei about _who's that on your right side?_ but Suisei answered the name on the left side.
- [ <YTTime Id="21ELJRyo-xI" Time="53:30" /> ] They announced the 1st Anniversary celebration plan, accepting fan arts and jingles.

## Summary of Season 1

The first year of Tokomachi Radio was a perfect run. Even their scheduled were packed with works and recordings, they still managed to have at least 1 day for the Tokomachi Radio.

It was a pity they dropped 2 episodes in Nov and Dec 2021 because of various reasons. But we still cannot deny the truth that the passion project did meant a lot for them.

Hope they can keep on in the second year.
