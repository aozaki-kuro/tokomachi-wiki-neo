## Tokomachi Radio

<Date D="2022-01-26" />

Episode 14 came after a 2-month-long gap and people were waiting anxiously for this.

## Game collab: Within Skerry

<Date D="2022-03-21" />

It has been another 2 months since last episode of Tokomachi Radio. <YTTime Id="yydLvFXNKtg" Time="86:10" Desc="The chat asked if there would be another episode this month" />, Suisei got pretty nervous and said there might not be an episode available since the scheduling problem (they got 3 lives in 2 weeks in total), but they might come up with a game collab recently.

Suisei also promoted for Sanbaka's Birthday Live which was held on 26th March. and said again about the wish that both of them had been holding: They still wish to work for **more cross-agency works**.

Suisei and Toko chose [<Fa name={[ 'brands' , 'steam' ]} /> Within Skerry](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1871510/Within_Skerry/) for their rare game collab.

The last game collab was the [Minecraft night fishing](/timeline/2020#new-year-) back to 30th Dec. 2020.

- [ <YTTime Id="rkOfEICgZRg" Time="03:27" Desc="Knock knock" /> ] Suisei was frightened by the _knock knock_ in the start page. Then Toko knocked the desk for her and ask _Hey Miss Hoshimachi are you ready?_
- [ <YTTime Id="rkOfEICgZRg" Time="40:45" Desc="Feeling down" /> ] They found a body which seemed to be in the form of `OTL`, means _feeling down_. Suisei joked that referred to herself when kept failing in gachas and having her cards suspended.
- [ <YTTime Id="rkOfEICgZRg" Time="45:20" Desc="Left or Right?" /> ] Suisei mentioned that she had some trouble when telling which side is left or right. Toko suddenly said _I really like how you were confused by directions_. Suisei also said she had the same troubles when playing APEX.
- [ <YTTime Id="rkOfEICgZRg" Time="48:43" Desc="From behind" /> ] Suisei and Toko spotted a doodle saying _I'm going to grab you all from behind and rip your faces off_. But both Suisei and Toko didn't get the meaning in Japanese. The chat translated that into _I will kiss you from behind_. Toko said again [in a funny way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkOfEICgZRg&t=2977s) to Suisei but then they realized that the meaning was totally the opposite.
- [ <YTTime Id="rkOfEICgZRg" Time="66:41" Desc="The two of us for life" /> ] Literally.

During the whole gameplay Suisei got frightened by nearly all jump scares and screamed a lot, but she got back to normal way faster than she did in previous solo horror game streams. There were multiple times that Suisei got really frightened and Toko comfort her saying words like _It's fine, I'm here_.

Since both of them didn't understand why some items were there and designed like this, Toko named most of the weird items as _modern art_.

On the other hand, Toko is nearly invincible to all kinds of horror games, unless there's chasing and action gameplay out there. So it was _the best choice_ to have Toko with her when playing those horror games.

Suisei also mentioned this at the end of the stream saying _The game was so frightening but thankfully I invited Miss Cerberus the Mighty to the stream_.
