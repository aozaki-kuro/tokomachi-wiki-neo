Episode 14 came after a 2-month-long gap and people were waiting anxiously for this.

## Game collab: Within Skerry

<Date D="2022-03-21" />

It has been another 2 months since last episode of Tokomachi Radio. <YTTime Id="yydLvFXNKtg" Time="86:10" Desc="The chat asked if there would be another episode this month" />, Suisei got pretty nervous and said there might not be an episode available since the scheduling problem (they got 3 lives in 2 weeks in total), but they might come up with a game collab recently.

Suisei also promoted for Sanbaka's Birthday Live which was held on 26th March. and said again about the wish that both of them had been holding: They still wish to work for more cross-agency works.

Suisei and Toko chose [<Fa name={[ 'brands' , 'steam' ]} /> Within Skerry](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1871510/Within_Skerry/) for their rare game collab.

The last game collab was the [Minecraft night fishing](/timeline/2020#new-year-) back to 30th Dec. 2020.

- [ <YTTime Id="rkOfEICgZRg" Time="35:12" Desc="Left or Right?" /> ] Suisei mentioned that she had some trouble when deciding which is left or right. Toko suddenly said _In my opinion, I think you are cute because of this._
- [ <YTTime Id="rkOfEICgZRg" Time="35:32" Desc="From behind" /> ] Suisei and Toko spotted a doodle saying _abd_ and Suisei didn't get the meaning in Japanese. The chat translated that into _I will kiss you from behind_. Toko said again in a funny way to Suisei but then they realized that the translation was totally not right.
- [ <YTTime Id="rkOfEICgZRg" Time="61:02" Desc="The two of us for life" /> ]

During the whole gameplay Suisei got scared by nearly all jump scares but she got back to normal way faster than she did in previous solo horror game streams. There were multiple times that Suisei got really frightened and Toko comfort her saying words like _It's fine, I'm here_.

Suisei also mentioned this at the end of the stream saying _The game was so frightening but thankfully I invited Miss Cerberus the Mighty to the stream_.
