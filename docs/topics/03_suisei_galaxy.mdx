Suisei announced the guests for her 1st solo live and according to her, both of them are really important to her.

AZKi, the other VTuber / singer affiliated to INNK Music, Suisei's colleague. She represents the **Past** of Suisei.

Toko, Suisei's friend, her close partener in music, affiliated to NIJISANJI. She represents the **Future** of Suisei.

It was the third time Suisei and Toko singing and dancing together on same live stage.

Suisei said clearly that she would like to forge her future with Toko. Suisei would also break the walls between agencies, even the barriers between Virtual and the Reality. It's the _BREAKTHROUGH_ she had been longing for.

## Suisei's way to invite Toko as guest

> <YTLink Id="21ELJRyo-xI&t=2157s" />

Since this episode was held after Suisei announced the guest lineup for her 1st solo live. Suisei talked about the details on how she invited Toko.

It happened around April 2021, during the overnight party held in Suisei's apartment. It was the next morning, Toko and Suisei sitting on sofa. Then Suisei told Toko she's going to hold her 1st solo live, and then asked Toko _Will you come?_. Toko answered _Oh why not?_.

They talked in a very calm way.

Toko was pretty happy to see people thought she would definitely be there. Also she mentioned it's not that easy to stand on that stage with Suisei even they said it in a casual way. Toko also was glad to know her and Suisei's audiences started to get over the barriers between agencies.

## After talk

Both Suisei and Toko said few after the live and according to Suisei, she already said too much during the MC part.

Suisei and Toko mentioned they got 2 professional dancers backing them up. Especially [<SNSIcon Name="twitter" /> Araki Yuka](https://twitter.com/araki__yuka), she worked for the live concerts of Kizuna Ai, Hatsune Miku, even LiSA. So Tokomachi won't have to imitate the origianl MV or design their own dance steps from ground zero. The other dancer was [<SNSIcon Name="twitter" /> Mai Itamoto](https://twitter.com/mai_dance_mai).

Suisei also mentioned that comparing to spending hours during "who i am", they spent less time in dance rehearsal this time. They attended the dance lesson for 3 times and rehearsed for 6 times in total.

The dance steps were designed to not strictly synchronize with each other, but it made Tokomachi's performances even more attractive, especially the pose and light works in the end, it perfectly matched the cover arkwork of _OUT OF FRAME_.
