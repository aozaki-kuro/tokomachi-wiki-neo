## MC

Suisei was very excited seeing the live guests since she had been on virtual live stages.

MC1:

- Suisei is not affiliated to NIJISANJI.
- They bought the same size of water (different from normal), fried chicken and meat steamed buns without discussion.
- There might be already soul-level connections between them.
- They started to exchange their ways of laughing, Toko started to laugh in Suisei did and Suisei did an "Aha↑" before in the street.
- Toko is feeling shy when saying "Toko-chan is cute today" because she's already over 200 years.
- Toko did gacha for Suisei and got the target character.

MC2:

- Toko is exhausted after singing and dancing with Suisei for 2 songs.
- Toko admitted that she's over 200 years old while Suisei is eternal 18 years and was totally alright.
- They thought it would be great to dance while singing, but they got no professional dancing tutor so they have to watch the MV over and over again to remember the dance step which cost them a long long time.
