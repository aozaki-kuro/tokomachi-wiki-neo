## Night Fishing

<Date D="2020-01-27" />

> <YTLink Id="bwAXmu5uYes" />

After hearing the announcement of _Ensemble Stars !!_ they were way too excited to sleep soundly. So they started to do a guerilla Minecraft night fishing stream and talking with each other.

Since it was right after, except talking about EnSta, they also mentioned they were pretty moved by each other's songs.

> <YTTime Id="bwAXmu5uYes" Time="23:05" Desc="Oops, wrong fishing rod" />

Suisei also renamed their fishing rods and put their names on each other's rod. But she mistakenly gave her rod to Toko. Toko joked that she won't give it back cutely. Suisei suddenly "threatened" to sing _Infinity Stars_, an _Ensemble Stars !!_ song and Toko was frighted, giving back Suisei's rod immediately.

As mentioned above, EnSta / Happy Elements are very famous for having a strict copyright guideline, which means if Suisei did sing that song, Toko's YouTube channel would be demonetized, something what every YouTuber / Vtuber fears most.

This was called _the special way of singers to threaten_.

## 3D Model Announcement

<Date D="2020-03-01" />

Suisei's 3D model announcement was scheduled on March 1st, 2020 and Toko's was a day later.

They were pretty happy about this.

<details> <summary>Twitter Conversation</summary>

  <img src={require('/img/twitter/20200226_02.jpg').default} />
</p>

</details>

Suisei chose to make her 3D reveal event into a 3D live (being one of the first to do so in Hololive).

In her own 3D reveal event the day after (March 2nd, 2020), Toko began her event by singing _Hello_, and ended with _RE:I AM_ (Aimer).

Both Suisei and Toko's 3D models appeared first in their respective agency's major festivals (Non-Stop Story and Virtual to Live), and were revealed on their own YouTube channels afterwards.

## Karaoke for 8 hours

### The Delay and The Karaoke

Unfortunately the release of _Ensemble Stars !!_ was delayed because of various problems and difficulties. Both Suisei and Toko felt pretty down because of this. So on 8th March, they decided to solve it in singers' way - they cancelled their stream and went to Karaoke together, singing only songs of _Ensemble Stars !_

According to Suisei's interview on [<Fa name={[ 'solid' , 'book' ]} /> _Hikari TV Guide (Page 49, Vol. 163, October 2020)_](https://www.hikaritv.net/guide/pdf/202110.pdf), the Karaoke tour lasted for _8 hours_.

### First Tokomachi Cover

> [<SNSIcon Name="twitter" /> Original Tweet](https://twitter.com/suisei_hosimati/status/1239146084712083456)

On 15th March, _Sajou no Roukaku_ was released as the first ever Tokomachi cover song (without MV). Due to EnSta / Happy Elements' well-known strict copyright guideline, they had to do it with no instrumental track and uploaded it to Twitter only.

## Gacha Stream

<Date D="2020-04-02" />

![EnSta maxed out](/img/youtube/20200402_01.jpg)

The original goal was to get Sakuma Ritsu's character card for 5 times.

Suisei was pretty famous for having a bad luck, on the other hand, Toko was way more fortunate in Gacha games. So Toko was somehow supposed to be her guardian, provide her some "luck" and watched over her on stream, Suisei still successfully maxed out her credit card on stream.

The stream was done before _Ensemble Stars !!_ got a guarantee system that let you get the picked up character at least for once after doing a certain amount of gachas. So she spent way more than expected (approximately 190,000 JPY).

This was also the first non-Minecraft game collab stream.

## MUSIC SPACE

![MUSIC SPACE](/img/youtube/mspe.jpg)

[<Fa name={[ 'solid' , 'music' ]} /> Hoshimachi Suisei's Music Space](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAo9RlHR2tDb_gfVgqd0wKknI7oE8etmV) (Discontinued)

This is Hoshimachi Suisei's first ever radio program. The program focuses on music, and singing cover songs was one of its major segments. During it's run, Suisei invited a lot of Vtubers, singers and music-related talents to the program.

The program started on April 4th, 2020 and was discontinued on March 28th, 2021 due to the program reform of Bunka Housou.

:::caution Note

\#08 and \#09 were recorded remotely due to COVID-19.

### Sudden Appearance and Promotion

> <YTTime Id="8b7WYQ2vvSA" Time="81:13" Desc="Suisei appeared" />

Suisei was on a [<SNSIcon Name="twitter" /> one week-long break](https://twitter.com/suisei_hosimati/status/1262763428931702790) but she appeared in Inui Toko's Minecraft Server while she was on stream unexpectedly. It was an informal collab, so Suisei had her mic off and only communicated via Minecraft chat.

Toko was also surprised to see her since Suisei should have been on break. During this time, Suisei fished and was fished in return by Toko, and she also showed off her [_Lightspeed Idol Outfit Change_](https://youtu.be/8b7WYQ2vvSA?t=5743). It's been a long time since Suisei last played Minecraft, so it seemed like she had already forgotten how to play, however she still managed to act in a funny way and made Toko laugh a lot.

Suisei promoted for her radio program tomorrow since Toko would be the guest.

<details> <summary>The conversation and reactions</summary>

:comet: : Here I come! (started to _fish_ Toko with her fishing rod)

:comet: : Everybody, please listen to my radio program!

:tropical_drink: : Well, she is that kind of idol who won't forgot to promote for her own program even when she's on her vacation.

:tropical_drink: : Are you having a good time Hoshimachi?

(Suisei Still trying to fish Toko happily)

:tropical_drink: : Alright, it seems like she's having a good time

> [<SNSIcon /> MUSIC SPACE #08 (Second half)](https://youtu.be/6NZJpD45MOU)

This was the first time Suisei invited a non-hololive talent to her radio program.

They mentioned the place they want to go together was _Tokyo Disney Land_, and while they were there, Toko wanted to go to the Gourmet Tour in _Tokyo Disney Land_.

<details> <summary>About Toko's ears</summary>

(Talking about wearing the Mickey Mouse ears)

:comet: : So there would be two kinds of ears... what would happen to your dog-like ears...

:tropical_drink: : Not dog. **Cerberus**.

:comet: : Well then what should we call the ear of Cerberus (nani mimi)?

:tropical_drink: : Cerberus ears (keru mimi).

:comet: : First time hearing (hatsu mimi)!

Note:

- _Don't_ even try to call Toko a dog, she _doesn't_ like it.
- Cerberus ears = Keruberusu Mimi

<details> <summary>Live performance</summary>

Toko mentioned that she didn't just want to _sing together_, but also to _dance together_.

Suisei said her favorite part of Toko is she always laughs so happily. On the other hand, Toko mentioned that Suisei also laughs a lot. Their conversations were able to stay alive for long periods of time and they gained a lot of common language because of this.

Suisei really liked Toko's performance on Virtual to Live 2019. Toko also invited Suisei to watch the _Blu-ray_ replay together at home.

</details>

<details> <summary>Toko curious about Anemachi</summary>

Toko thought Anemachi (Suisei's elder sister) was pretty funny. Anemachi often shows up, not just during their the last collab gacha stream, but she also shows up when Suisei's going on long calls with Toko at night. Anemachi even invited Toko to go the _Tokyo Disney Land_ together.

Suisei said that she was influenced by Anemachi into becoming an Otaku. Toko said that it seemed like it's because of Anemachi that they can can meet each other.

Toko also has an elder sister who she affectionately calls Aneberus, and that she also got influenced by her elder sister into reading Manga and watching anime, just like Suisei.

</details>

<details> <summary>What should we eat?</summary>

Suisei and Toko often go for a meal (mainly barbecues) in 2019. Suisei always decided on the food pretty fast since she's mainly interested in meat and beef.

For their next meal, they quickly decided that it should be [<Fa name={[ 'brands' , 'wikipedia-w' ]} /> Shabushabu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabu-shabu)

</details>

<details> <summary>Feeling nervous on stage?</summary>

A fan letter asked whether there were monsters on the stage (whether they would feel nervous on live concert stage), Toko and Suisei said they are more excited than nervous when seeing the audiences and the glow sticks in their hands.

Even when there are, it seemed like Toko would _politely eat them up_ since she is the _mighty mighty Cerberus_.

This is the first time Suisei and Toko being able to sing together on air. Since Bunka Housou is able to solve the copyright, they chose not only Yorushika, but also EnSta songs.

EnSta / Happy Element is well-known for a very strict copyright guideline.

The songs they sang in this episode were

- [<SNSIcon /> Hana ni Bourei / Yorushika](https://youtu.be/dgOe9gVype0)

In the talking part, they did a simple "psychological test".

<details> <summary>"Psychological test"</summary>

Q: The color of the cup that you would give to your friend when she's paying a visit to your house. The color you choose might indicates the relationship between you and your friend.

`A. Green`, `B. Orange`, `C. Blue`, `D. Pink`

Toko selected `C. Blue` : If there are troubles, you would help her out and she would do the same. When you are in trouble, you often ask for help from her don't you? And when she's in trouble you would help her out without hesitation.

Suisei selected `D. Pink` : You often share happiness with her. Did you often go shopping or having meals with her? Sometimes you share new info or go to new scenic spots with each other. She always can cheer you up.

Toko and Suisei agreed on this is pretty accurate and this is _teetee_.

</details>

Suisei mentioned every time she talked with Toko end up in laughing a lot with Toko. Suisei really love Toko's jokes and topics.

The songs they sang in this episode were

- [<SNSIcon /> Kaze wa Yokoku naku Fuku / Walküre](https://youtu.be/ZLxHpZv8wLA)
- [<SNSIcon /> Mémoire Antique / Valkyrie (Ensemble Stars!)](https://youtu.be/Zo24u1KBB0U)

### Reason Why Suisei Likes Toko :star:

> <YTTime Id="I58nqKO2fak" Time="42:27" Desc="Suisei talking about Toko" />

Suisei talked about the MUSIC RADIO episode in the own chatting stream.

And the reason why Suisei really likes Toko

- Toko was always interesting and positive.
- Toko can make Suisei laugh a lot.
- Toko often joked on Suisei and the jokes won't be over-the-line.
- Beside jokes, Toko also praised and supported Suisei a lot.
- Mutual respect. Even they had known each other for more than a year and became pretty close friends, they can still keep a proper distance and won't let each other feel uncomfortable.

Suisei also asked the clippers not to clip this because she felt pretty shy and worried about if Toko would see this. Well, the clip still got noticed by Toko and [something even more interesting](/timeline/2021#small-revenge-) happened a year later.

## Totsumachi :star:

<Date D="2020-09-09" />

![Totsumachi](/img/youtube/20200909_01.jpg)

The Totsumachi (waiting for friends to make a Discord call) was held on Inui Toko's birthday.

Suisei called in and said _happy birthday_ to Toko, and they also talked about a lot of other topics.

### First Impression

When talking about _How Suisei knew Toko_, Suisei said it was her indie days, someone (refers to [<SNSIcon /> Hiro Minamori (graduated)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuGMkxJA_icuiF01u8f3Y2Q)) introduced Toko to Suisei.

Suisei's first impression of Toko was _Huh that traditional Japanese style NIJISANJI girl!_

Toko's first impression of Suisei was _Huh, what a vocally talented girl!_

There they also mentioned that they want to sing together more, not only just singing together on radio, but they also wanted to make song cover songs.

### Other Topics

:comet: : Hello everyone I'm Hoshimachi Suisei from NIJISANJI!

### Teasing

On October 26th, 2020 Suisei tweeted and mentioned she would have an announcement but not on her own channel.

### Announcement

That night 20:00 JST Inui Toko started her Karaoke stream and the title said _I got some announcements_.

> <YTTime Id="Q1t_vUj-fJQ" Time="34:28" Desc="Announcement 2, solo live" />

Her first announcement was _her first original song was on its way_.

The second announcement was _Inui Toko 1st solo live "who i am"_ was going to be held on Dec 10th, 2020.

The most astonishing thing was _Hoshimachi Suisei appeared as one of the live guests_. It was the first time a hololive member appeared on NIJISANJI paid event / live concert so that was a big surprise.

According to Toko, all guests (Lize Helesta, Ange Katrina, Higuchi Kaede and **Hoshimachi Suisei**) are extremely important to her and that's why she invited them to her 1st solo live.

## Tokomachi Radio

<Date D="2020-10-28" />

![radio](/img/youtube/tokomachi_radio_01.jpg)

> <YTLink Id="6WYpnMNcA_8" />

As Toko and Suisei successfully came over the obstacles between 2 agencies, they decided to take it further and started Tokomachi Radio.

Tokomachi Radio is a monthly radio program, scheduled on the 3rd Wednesday of every month.

Although the radio wasn't actually always on time, they successfully made a perfect run in the first year.

Tokomachi's dreams

- Radio program
- Duo original songs
- Duo concert lives

There they also announced that their first cover song MV would be uploaded on Oct. 31st, 2020.

## First Tokomachi Cover MV

<Date D="2020-10-31" />

![cover](/img/youtube/20201031_01.jpg)

> > [_<Fa name={[ 'solid' , 'crow' ]} /> Koyoi Tsuki no Yakata ni te , Valkyrie (Ensemble Stars!!)_](https://youtu.be/vhmFj1owmuk)

This was the first Tokomachi cover song MV uploaded to YouTube channel.

The song was from _Ensemble Stars! Album series Valkyrie_.

According to the comments, the song fits their image - cute but also sometimes be very handsome.

The song reached 1m replay in approximately a month. Considering EnSta is a rather unfamiliar genre for both Suisei and Toko's audiences, this is a pretty impressive record back in late 2020.

<FYI Topic="Music Main List" Desc="/topics/music_list" />

### Watch-along

> [<SNSIcon /> Watch-along Stream](https://youtu.be/tYFl1QqQjq8)

They also had a watch-along stream. Since there were no latency when they shouted out _Kyou mo kawaii!_ so this is highly possible an off collab.

They partially swapped their greetings.

<details> <summary>Toko's greetings</summary>

:tropical_drink: : It's your shooting star...

:comet: : What?

:tropical_drink: : Your Cerberus in the rough...

:comet: : What??

:tropical_drink: : Inui Toko from NIJISANJI!

:comet: : LOOOOOOL

</details>

They enjoyed the recording and wanted to do that for 5000 more times.

### Avatars

Toko and Suisei changed their Twitter avatars for their duo cover songs since this time.

They changed back to each others' avatar for solo works after August, 2021.

## New Year :star:

<Date D="2020-12-30" />

![fishing](/img/youtube/20201230_01.jpg)

> [<SNSIcon /> Suisei Channel](https://youtu.be/U5YCqWyIY6Q) , [<SNSIcon /> Inui Toko](https://youtu.be/SyiZD22NVeY)

Since Dec. 31st both agencies has their own official celebration program, 30th was considered the last free time for the talents to stream in their own channel.

Suisei and Toko decided to stream together for the night and look back on the past whole year.

They swapped their greeting _again_ at the start.

<details> <summary>Greetings ( 02:00 - )</summary>

:comet: : Welcome! It's your official mighty mighty Idol from hololive, Hoshimachi Suisei.

:tropical_drink: : Eh, uh? Emmmmm...

:comet: : What's wrong?

:tropical_drink: : Welcome! Eh? It's your shooting star Cerberus... Inui Toko.

:tropical_drink: : We are?

:comet: & :tropical_drink: : To, Tokomachi desu!

:tropical_drink: : Well go to sleep. (In Minecraft)

</details>

Toko thought she started her stream but it turned out to be no. She noticed something's not wrong when seeing the audiences are playing around with emotes.

After that they greeted again with greetings swapped _again_.

The Minecraft server was Inui Kingdom, Suisei also took her and Toko's bed to the hut beside the lake.

To conclude 2020, Suisei chose _Hon_ (奔, Dash), Toko chose _Ai_ (愛, Love).

And in 2020

- The time Suisei spent with Toko was longer than the others, so did Toko.
- _Our friendship is 100 deeper than last year!_
- They were very happy they were able to cheer people up with lives and streams.
- They found out there were so many things to want to do together and it's more interesting to have it done as Tokomachi.
- Toko once worried that once they go closer, she might not being able to get along well with Suisei. But the fact was they became very, very good friends.
- Their interest, favorite food, their goals were nearly the same.
- For Toko, Suisei was the one spending the least time deciding what to eat.
- Although Suisei's choice for meal was limited (Barbecue, Family restaurant or Shabushabu).
- Suisei loves to wear high heels when she goes shopping with Toko, but often got tipped over. Toko is a little bit higher than Suisei, so she often walks a little bit behind Suisei and watches over her to prevent Suisei actually got tipped over.
- Suisei often do some funny moves that would make Toko laugh.
- Both Suisei and Toko were very afraid of Enderman.

Suisei was fishing and Toko watched over Suisei throughout the whole stream.

## Summary of 2020

They year 2020 was a big turning point for both Suisei and Toko.

Their friendship was deepened and their dreams began to realize:

- Their own radio program
- (EnSta) cover songs
- Singing and dancing on the same live stage

And they are going to take this further in 2021.

## Appendix: Casual Tweet
