# とこまち電台 第一季

![top](/img/radio/top_s1.jpg)

:::info 關於內容

大部分的集數都只是閒聊而已，僅有相當重要或有趣的主題會被挑選並記錄下來。

:::

**完整標題：**とこまちラジオ（仮）

此廣播節目為兩個追尋她們夢想的女孩所創立的一場綜藝秀。

她們的第一步就是這個廣播節目。

## 第 1 集：開端

<Date D="2020-10-28" />

第一集，她們兩人仍難以置信它成真了。她們說這是她們朝向夢想的第一步。

她們的夢想是

- [x] 雙人電台節目
- [x] 雙人原創曲
- [ ] 雙人演唱會

她們夢想著能在豐洲 PIT 一起唱歌跳舞。一年後，她們在 [<SNSIcon /> すいせい的第一場個人演唱會](/topics/suisei_galaxy)中成功實現了這個夢想。

第一集中，她們收到超過 300 封來信，選了 4 封來閱讀。

とこ對すいせい的結論: 唱歌、俄羅斯方塊、神經病。

すいせい對とこ的結論: 唱歌、夜釣、閒聊。

とこまち一起唱歌時經常會有點小麻煩，因為とこ的最高音比すいせい的最低音還低很多，這影響了她們一起唱歌時的選曲。

對她們而言，偶像夢幻祭 2 就是教導她們如何成為偶像的寶典，而她們最喜歡的台詞是“只有愛是無法當偶像的，但沒有了愛永遠都不可能會成為偶像。”

最後她們又公告了一次[とこ的第一場個人演唱會](/topics/toko_who_i_am)，並宣布了她們[第一首翻唱曲的 MV](/timeline/2020#first-tokomachi-cover-mv)。

## 第 2 集

<Date D="2020-11-25" />

> <YTLink Id="ZONauvZUkEY" />

すいせい從一開始就超級吵。

備受喜愛的「破音羅密歐」片段也是從這集來的。

> <YTTime Id="ZONauvZUkEY" Time="25:08" Desc="破音羅密歐" /> (Please reduce the volume)

<details> <summary>翻譯</summary>

:comet: ：喔！！！茱麗葉！！！為什麼妳是茱麗葉？？？？？

:comet: ：為什麼！！！妳喝了毒藥嗎茱麗葉？？？

:tropical_drink: ：我…我想…

:comet: ：為什麼！！！為什麼茱麗葉！！！

:tropical_drink: ：讓我說話羅密歐…

:comet: : 喔妳還能說話茱麗葉！告訴我怎麼了！

:tropical_drink: ：（短劇限制時間）還只剩下兩秒了。

譯註：原著中羅密歐與茱麗葉幽會時都應盡可能保持安靜。

## 第 3 集

<Date D="2020-12-23" />

> <YTLink Id="s6OPCzpCep4" />

那時候她們正處於活動高峰期，尤其是すいせい有五場演唱會要參加，因此她們以十分愜意的步調來主持這一集。

她們非常開心大家在看了她們在とこ第一次個人演唱會的表演後開始玩偶像夢幻祭了。

她們提到她們花了很多時間在練舞室裡練習舞步，還要錄下舞步，在去練習室前確認她們跳得如何。所以她們有一份從笨手笨腳到熟練的完整紀錄，她們聲稱那是很珍貴的回憶。

## 第 4 集

<Date D="2021-01-27" />

> <YTLink Id="Kr1jxq0ms00" />

這是 2021 年的第一集，因此有很多有關新年計畫的話題。

> <YTTime Id="VH0XOn6ceSA" Time="04:42" Desc="確認方式" />

とこ和すいせい在一起出去玩之前會先以一種特別的方式來確認彼此是否已經醒來。

<details> <summary>とこまち的方法</summary>

:tropical_drink: : RISKY VENUS!

:comet: : HEY!

</details>

> <YTTime Id="VH0XOn6ceSA" Time="22:47" Desc="什麼是偶像？" />

其中一封觀眾來信詢問とこまち“對兩位而言，什麼是偶像？”，然後她們想了很長的一段時間。

最後的答案讓人超意外。

<details> <summary>とこまち的答案</summary>

:comet: ：每個閃耀著光芒的人！

:tropical_drink: ：星街すいせい。

## 第 5 集：宝鐘マリン

<Date D="2021-02-24" />

![marine](/img/radio/20210224.jpg)

:::note 注意

此內容較著重於とこまち。

:::

> <YTLink Id="5JpC8ec5dfw" />

這集是初次有來賓和她們一起廣播。由於她們只有兩張椅子，すいせい只得和とこ坐在一起。

This was the first time having a guest on air with them. Since there were only 2 chairs, Suisei had to sit with Toko.

邀請 [<SNSIcon /> 宝鐘マリン](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCzUftO8KOVkV4wQG1vkUvg)（又稱船長）的原因其實非常簡單：在所有 hololive 成員中，她對マリン最有興趣。而マリン跟すいせい很熟，她嘗試與とこ談論一些不適合工作場所的主題（用マリン的話來說就是色色的話題）來開話題，とこ以冷淡的反應來回應那些話題。

とこ和すいせい兩人都必須做些什麼來阻止マリン在直播中討論不適合工作場所的主題。

由於すいせい與リゼ・ヘルエスタ的髮色相近，而マリン的與アンジュ・カトリーナ類似，とこ+すいせい+マリン也被視為另一種形式上的さんばか。

### 時間戳

- [ <YTTime Id="5JpC8ec5dfw" Time="13:51" /> ] 據すいせい所言，とこ可以被歸類為 S（虐待狂）。
- [ <YTTime Id="5JpC8ec5dfw" Time="28:49" /> ] すいせい不知道什麼是離島，マリン也是。すいせい甚至還說"日本也是離島嗎?"。とこ被逗得狂笑，然後說“妳們兩個是笨蛋嗎？”
- [ <YTTime Id="5JpC8ec5dfw" Time="46:42" /> ] 最後的短劇中，すいせい是王子，マリン是魔王，而とこ是公主。マリン盡力的阻止すいせい拯救とこ，且“戰況”十分激烈。最後とこ突然說“但我要嫁給王子！”，接著魔王マリン就很難過的安靜離開了。

## 第 6 集：アンジュ・カトリーナ :star:

<Date D="2021-03-25" />

![Ange](/img/radio/20210325.jpg)

:::note 注意

此內容較著重於とこまち。

:::

> <YTLink Id="nlkJdUZU5Ws" />

第六集她們邀請了 [<SNSIcon /> アンジュ・カトリーナ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHVXbQzkl3rDfsXWo8xi2qw)作為來賓。すいせい在とこ第一場個人演唱會的準備及預演時就見過アンジュ了。

這集仍被視為另一種形式上的さんばか（すいせい ≒ リゼ）。

### 時間戳

- [ <YTTime Id="nlkJdUZU5Ws" Time="03:20" /> ] とこ提到すいせい在她 3 月 22 日三週年時聲音的變化，すいせい說她超緊張而且也很擔心這件事，還諮詢了とこ很長一段時間，不過結果發現她的觀眾們十分順利的接受了這個轉變。
- [ <YTTime Id="nlkJdUZU5Ws" Time="09:15" /> ] すいせい編了一些像是她們聊了很多、一起去吃飯或去 KTV 這類從來沒發生過的事，這讓アンジュ害羞了起來，而とこ被逗得止不住笑意。すいせい說“欸我們還為了女生之間的談話而去了旅館呢”的時候，とこ甚至還裝作她在嫉妒。
- [ <YTTime Id="nlkJdUZU5Ws" Time="10:51" /> ] すいせい說有一次她在旅館辦了一場通宵派對。
- [ <YTTime Id="nlkJdUZU5Ws" Time="14:33" /> ] とこ提到在她第一場個人演唱會時，休息室都是分開的，不過すいせい還是很常去彩虹社的休息室和其他人一起玩。すいせい還宣稱“我也是彩虹社的一員，僅限今天。”
- [ <YTTime Id="nlkJdUZU5Ws" Time="17:17" /> ] すいせい說她初次看到アンジュ的出道直播時，アンジュ的真實性別一直有點困惑。這個答案讓とこ從頭笑到尾，然後說“難以置信妳被這件事困擾了這麼久！”
- [ <YTTime Id="nlkJdUZU5Ws" Time="21:19" /> ] アンジュ覺得すいせい和とこ之間的互動很有趣，她們總是聊個不停。
- [ <YTTime Id="nlkJdUZU5Ws" Time="22:55" /> ] とこ提到她們笑的方式開始互換了，すいせい常常在東京的街上大聲的發出「啊哈 ↑」的笑聲，而とこ開始以比較“端莊”的方式笑。

### カトリーナ一家

其中一封觀眾來信詢問，如果她們都是家庭中的一員的話，分別會在什麼位置呢？

すいせい和とこ立刻回答並且同意她們應該是**雙胞胎姐妹**。

然後アンジュ應該是會寵壞女兒的**父親**，而リゼ是嚴厲的**母親**。アンジュ她自己也贊同這個安排，而且とこ甚至還模仿了當アンジュ試著寵溺女兒時リゼ可能會說的話。

<details> <summary>想像中發火的リゼ媽媽 💢</summary>

:crown: ：アンジュ你為什麼總是留下這種爛攤子給我！

:crown: ：你從不告訴她們什麼是對的什麼是錯的，那就是為什麼這種事總是一再發生！

:scales: ：但…但我不想被女兒們討厭……

</details>

然後とこ和すいせい就裝的像是小嬰兒一樣，接著アンジュ就無法克制想寵愛她們的衝動。

## Episode 07: Off Collab

<Date D="2021-04-30" />

> <YTLink Id="kR9mSvUyfkY" />

This was a special episode having Toko streaming with Suisei together at Suisei's apartment. Tokomachi both had their Live2D avatar activated.

#### Major Topics

The major topic was about Suisei's 3rd Anniversary Live "SPACE for Virtual GHOST".

<FYI Topic="SPACE for Virtual GHOST" Desc="/topics/suisei_ghost#tokomachi-side" />

#### Other Topics

The best songs for them were _Ensemble Stars_ songs.

If they are going to have a band, Suisei would be the pianist and Toko would play [<Fa name={[ 'brands' , 'wikipedia-w' ]} /> Shakuhachi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakuhachi).

If they can only eat one kind of food for a year, they choose to eat fried chicken or potato chips.

About the childhood dream job. Suisei's was idol singer and Toko's was Cerberus.

They both lie about their jobs to the barbers.

## Episode 08

<Date D="2021-05-28" />

> <YTLink Id="8sqE4VgaT0w" />

Another beloved scene, _Suisei making grated radish_ came from this episode.

> <YTTime Id="8sqE4VgaT0w" Time="07:13" Desc="Suisei making grated radish" />

This happened during Toko's stay at Suisei's apartment for an overnight party. Suisei was making dinner for Toko and grated radish was one of both Toko and Suisei's favorite dish. But her movements were so exaggerated and funny, her full body and her hair was shaking fiercely as if there was an earthquake.

Toko was amused by this at first glance and took a video of this.

There was an official animated clip for this in [Episode 13](/radio/tokomachi_radio_s1#episode-13-1st-anniversary-).

Other topics:

- [ <YTTime Id="8sqE4VgaT0w" Time="11:08" /> ] They do share dishes when going out for meal, but only those acceptable ones (e.g. french fries). They still tend to order different dishes.
- [ <YTTime Id="8sqE4VgaT0w" Time="18:29" /> ] They both tend to sleep or staying at home relaxed during heavy rain days (unless there's work).

## Episode 09

<Date D="2021-06-24" />

> <YTLink Id="RrX2uuMeAW8" />

> <YTTime Id="RrX2uuMeAW8" Time="02:18" Desc="It's already episode 9" />

Both Toko and Suisei were surprised that they were able to reach Episode 9. The title _Tokomachi Radio (Temp)_ seemed like already had been accepted as the formal title. Toko also mentioned that they did asked their audiences if there were better ideas in title renaming. But a lot of them thought Tokomachi won't treat it formally and would stop after doing a few episodes.

> <YTTime Id="RrX2uuMeAW8" Time="12:08" Desc="Menu for Tokomachi Cafe?" />

One of the fan letters asked what would Tokomachi arrange for their collab Cafe.

<details> <summary>Tokomachi Menu</summary>

- Cream soda
- Apple juice
- French fries decorated with
  - _Confeito_
  - Unknown flower from the underworld
- Meat (Barbecue)
- _Shabushabu_
- Suisei-motif desserts
  - Chiffon cake with strawberry (and a _su_ stands for Suisei)

</details>

Since both Toko and Suisei were not that in favor of desserts and sweets they have no further plans to put more on their menu.

> <YTTime Id="RrX2uuMeAW8" Time="18:48" Desc="Reactions on horror games" />

Toko and Suisei streamed [<Fa name={[ 'brands' , 'steam' ]} /> Night Delivery](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1611490/Night_Delivery) several days before the radio. Suisei was scared and screamed on a jump scare scene while Toko reacted very calmly as if she's wondering _what the hell are you doing?_

Their audiences also noticed that Toko and Suisei's collab (except radio) were only Minecraft or chatting. The only non-Minecraft collab stream was that EnSta gatcha stream but the archive were privated.

Toko was not afraid of horror games, but she hated to be chased in games. Also both of them thought Minecraft is somehow more terrifying than most horror games because of Enderman and silverfish.

They planned to try something else for game collab like [<Fa name={[ 'brands' , 'steam' ]} /> Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes](https://store.steampowered.com/app/341800/Keep_Talking_and_Nobody_Explodes/) or [<Fa name={[ 'solid' , 'palette' ]} /> Gartic Phone](https://garticphone.com/) as a start, but so far (till Feb. 2022) they weren't able to take a step forward on game collab. The only exception was they both got invited to Shiro's channel for Mario Party collab.

## Episode 10

<Date D="2021-07-30" />

> <YTLink Id="pT5uYMHtmL0" />

They first talked about the release of Toko's 1st solo live Blu-ray disc.

<FYI Topic="who i am" Desc="/topics/toko_who_i_am#blu-ray-disc" />

> <YTTime Id="pT5uYMHtmL0" Time="50:40" Desc="Eggplant doria with no eggplant please" />

This was the most beloved funny scene from Tokomachi Radio S1.

Suisei was such a picky eater that she nearly refuse to eat any kind of vegetables.

<details> <summary>Eggplant doria with no eggplant please</summary>

:comet: : Excuse me, may I order eggplant doria but without eggplant?

💁‍♀️ : Uh, yes but there would be only cheese and sauce...

:comet: : Wait what? No rice?

:tropical_drink: : :question::question:

💁‍♀️ : Ah there would be rice...

</details>

It also had an official animated clip in Episode 13.

## Episode 11

<Date D="2021-08-26" />

> <YTLink Id="B3ZDoOxQjnA" />

This episode was after Suisei's announcement of 1st album and 1st solo live, also right after Toko's 1st solo live Blu-ray sale. Toko's 1st solo live Blu-ray also won the 1st place in Oricon Blu-ray ranking.

Other topics:

- [ <YTTime Id="B3ZDoOxQjnA" Time="03:19" /> ] Toko replied immediately that would buy about 3 copies of their favorite album CD or live concert Blu-ray, while Suisei buy less goods.
- [ <YTTime Id="B3ZDoOxQjnA" Time="12:47" /> ] Toko decided part her live goods because _she wanted that_. Suisei never thought about the reason, just did it with her instinct.
- [ <YTTime Id="B3ZDoOxQjnA" Time="15:44" /> ] Toko said back to the rehearsal of her solo live, she once spotted an unrelated staff was wearing Suisei's motif T-shirt. She didn't recognized that at first glance and thought it was pretty cute.
- [ <YTTime Id="B3ZDoOxQjnA" Time="23:49" /> ] Suisei had to reply a message and asked Toko to talk for a while as solo.

---

## Episode 12

<Date D="2021-09-29" />

> <YTLink Id="21ELJRyo-xI" />

It was the 12th episode of the year, so it was _not_ 1st anniversary yet. Tokomachi got it wrong and nearly marked this as anniversary.

Toko talked about how Suisei invited her to attend her live as a guest.

<FYI Topic="STELLAR into the GALAXY" Desc="/topics/suisei_galaxy#suiseis-way-to-toko-as-guest" />

Other topics:

- [ <YTTime Id="21ELJRyo-xI" Time="16:16" /> ] Toko also checked Suisei's hashtag of her 1st album _Still Still Stellar_. She read the tweets while listening to the album. She felt really happy for Suisei and also loved the album very much.
- [ <YTTime Id="21ELJRyo-xI" Time="37:00" /> ] Toko was pretty happy that people thought she would definitely attend Suisei's live as a guest. But still Toko said it was not easy to actually stand on the stage with Suisei.
- [ <YTTime Id="21ELJRyo-xI" Time="38:13" /> ] Toko mentioned there were not too many inter-agencies scheduled programs by that time when Tokomachi radio started (Oct 2021). Even people was pretty pessimistic on the program and thought it might end in a month or two, they at least carried on for nearly a year by now.
- [ <YTTime Id="21ELJRyo-xI" Time="48:07" /> ] Toko mentioned once she asked Suisei about _who's that on your right side?_ but Suisei answered the name on the left side.
- [ <YTTime Id="21ELJRyo-xI" Time="53:30" /> ] They announced the 1st Anniversary celebration plan, accepting fan arts and jingles.

The rest part was a review on what happened in September, both Suisei and Toko got a lot of events announced back then.

## Summary of Season 1

The first year of Tokomachi Radio was a perfect run. Even their schedules were packed with works and recordings, they still managed to have at least 1 day for the Tokomachi Radio.

It was a pity they dropped 2 episodes in Nov and Dec 2021 because of various reasons. But we still cannot deny the truth that the passion project did meant a lot for them.

Hope they can keep on in the second year.
